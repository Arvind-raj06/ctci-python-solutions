## Question

Build a class `MyQueue` that implements a queue using two stacks.

<br />

Your class should implement the methods `enqueue`, `dequeue` and `peek`.

<br />

  <summary>Solution</summary>

  <br />

  The difference between a queue and a stack is that queues operate on a First In First Out basis while stacks operate on a First In Last Out basis.

  <br />

  This means that when you `push` N items on to the stack and then `pop` those N items off the stack, the **order of the N items will be reversed**. This is due to the **Last In First Out** property of stacks.

  <br />

  When you're working with a queue, however, **the order of items is maintained**. If you `enqueue` N items on to a queue and then `dequeue` those N items, the order of the items will remain the same. This is due to the **First In First Out** property of queues.

  <br />

  Therefore, if we want to build a queue with stacks, we have to design our data structure in a way so that the order of the items remains the same, rather than reversing (what a stack naturally does).

  <br />

  We can accomplish this by pushing each item inserted *through two stacks*. The first stack will reverse every item inserted. The second stack will reverse every item inserted *again*, which means going back to the original order.

  <br />

  So how do we implement this in code?

  <br />

  Whenever the user enqueues an item into our data structure, we'll `push` it to `stack1`.

  <br />

  Now, when we want `dequeue` items from our queue, we have to reverse the order.

  <br />

  We first call `_reverseStack` which handles transfering all the items from `stack1` to `stack2`.

  <br />

  Then, we can `pop` the last item in `stack2` and return that.

  <br /> 

  `peek` works the exact same way as `dequeue` except we are just returning the last item in `stack2` instead of popping it off.

  <br />

  The time complexity is $$O(n)$$ since each item is transferred from one stack to the other *once*. The space complexity is also $$O(n)$$.
  ```python
class stacksort:
    def _init_(self):
        self.stack=[]
    def sortStack(self):
        tmpStack = createStack() 
        while(isEmpty(self.stack) == False): 
            tmp = top(self.stack) 
            pop(self.stack)
            while(isEmpty(tmpStack) == False and int(top(tmpStack)) > int(tmp)): 
                push(stack,top(tmpStack))
                pop(tmpStack)
                push(tmpStack,tmp)
        return tmpStack
    
    def push(self, item): 
        self.stack.append(item) 
  
    def top(self): 
        p = len(self.stack) 
        return self.stack[p-1] 
    
    def pop(self): 
        if(len(self.stack)==0): 
            print("Stack Underflow ") 
            exit(1)
        return self.stack.pop()
  ```
